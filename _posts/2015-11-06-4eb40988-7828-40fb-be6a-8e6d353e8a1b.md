OK this is my first paragraph in the test blog. I really do not think so much of this environment. It's buggy, not so intuitive, over simplified. For instance, I changed the title of a website but it does not update when I submit the change.

This is paragraph two. Let's hope it goes better than other posts. In other posts, the order of the components in the editor is not the same as in the live site.

Next I will insert a photo...

This is lovely Madeleine, who in this shot looks very like her mother, Sabina. 

Another shot now, this time of Olivia...
